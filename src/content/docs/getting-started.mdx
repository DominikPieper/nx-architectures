The Nx Architecture documentation projects aims to collect information about different architectural styles people use in their projects.
There are a lot of information how to split projects technically with Nx, but not that much information how people tend to do it logically.
The target of the project is:

- Collect examples for people to look at and discuss
- Be a source for people to get inspired by looking at what worked for others.
- Add you own examples and discuss with others

:::caution[Disclaimer]
Please be positive. You can discuss and get inspired but do it friendly.
